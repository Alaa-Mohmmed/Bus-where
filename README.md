# Bus-where


The project idea is to provide real-time location updates of school bus to enable parents and school admin to locate school bus at any given moment during bus route so parents can ensure the safety of students, now you can say goodbye to manual school bus routing.
   This system uses GPS to track the location of the bus and will send details about the location of the bus to the admin. admin can find out the location of the driver driving the bus at any point of time and the speed range of the bus so the driver cannot do any type of cheating,  
Parent login to the system and check the real-time location of the bus, ensure that his child is on-broad before departing from the school and get alerts when his child has been dropped off.
Also, the system shows the admin dashboard about basic statistics about.
